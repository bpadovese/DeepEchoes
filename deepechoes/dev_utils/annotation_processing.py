def standardize(annotations, sep=',', labels='auto'):
    """ Standardize the annotation table format.

        The input table can be passed as a pandas DataFrame or as the filename of a csv file.

        The table headings are renamed to conform with the ketos standard naming convention, following the 
        name mapping specified by the user. 

        The label mapping is stored as a class attribute named 'label_dict' within the output table 
        and may be retrieved with `df.attrs['label_dict']`.

        Required Columns:
            - 'filename': The name or path of the file associated with each annotation.
            - 'label': The label or category associated with each annotation. If `unfold_labels` is True,
                    this column may contain multiple labels separated by `label_sep`.

            Optional Columns (depending on usage):
            - 'start': The start time or position of the annotation.
            - 'end': The end time or position of the annotation.

        Args:
            annotations: str, pandas DataFrame
                If a string, it is assumed to be the path to a CSV file containing the annotation table.
                If a pandas DataFrame, it is used directly as the annotation table.
            sep: str
                Separator. Only relevant if filename is specified. Default is ",".
            labels: 'auto', None, dict, or list
                - 'auto' (default): All unique labels in the table are automatically mapped to integers starting from 0.
                - None: No label mapping is applied, labels are left as-is.
                - dict: A user-specified mapping of labels to integers (Note that ketos expects labels to be incremental integers starting with 0).
                - list: A subset of labels to map to integers starting from 0.
                Any unspecified label is mapped to -1.

            has been done prior to calling this function. It is the responsibility of the user to ensure that the input

    Note: The shifting process can result in `start` and `end` times that fall outside the original

    the new start time will be -5. Similarly, if an annotation ends at 10 and a shift results 
    in a duration that extends beyond the recording length (e.g., to time 15 when the recording

            - Must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1.
            - 1 means the entire duration of the original interval must be contained
              within the shifted interval.
        duration : float, optional
            The duration of each shifted instance. If None, the original annotation's

            annotation is without shift and often corresponds to just the annotation
